In this study an agent-based model simulates the pollination of trees in a forest. The model assumes
continuous space and consists of two interacting agents; \emph{animals} and \emph{plants}.  We
consider different plant densities to determine what effect density has on the distribution of
pollen.  The plants have a limited supply of pollen that can be gathered by animals.  Animals
transport the pollen across the environment using particular movement rules to deliver the pollen to
other plants.  The animals movement is determined by a corrolated random walk.  At each step of
their movement they search the local neighborhood for plants where they will collect additional
pollen and deposit pollen.

\subsection{Movement} 
  Movement in the model is centered on the animals since plants do not move.
  Pollen is carried by the animals from one plant to another. At each step the movement of an animals
  in conducted in two stages:  {\it searching} and {\it movement}.  First, the animal checks the a
  neighborhood of radius $r$ to see if there are any trees within the neighborhood.  If there are one
  or more trees then the animal chooses the closest tree.  It there are two or more trees equidistant
  from the animals current location then one of those trees are chosen randomly.  The animal then
  moves to the location of the chosen tree.

  If there are no trees within a distance $r$ from the current location of the animal, the animal then
  moves according to a corrolated random walk.  For the correlated random walk the animal chooses a
  direction based on a probability distribution in which the higher probabilities are centered about
  the animal's current direction, see Figure \ref{TurningAngle}.  The animal then takes a step of
  length between 0 and 1 distributed uniformly in the new chosen direction.  This length is denoted by
  $s_j^{(i)}$, which is the $j^{th}-$step taken by the $i^{th}$ animal.

    \caption{Turning Angle for (a) uniform distribution and (b) depiction
    of what a path may look like.}
  \end{figure}
  Alternatively, if the animal is already at a plant then the animal picks a random direction
  uniformly and then takes a step of size $r+1.0$.  This will ensure that the animal will not
  immediately return to the same plant on the very next step.

\subsection{\emph{Pollination}}
  When an animal is on a plant, it collects pollen, distributes pollen, and consumes food. Each
  plant contains a number of flowers, $\phi$, from which an animal may obtain pollen. When an animal
  visits a plant it picks up pollen from one or more flowers. The number of flowers from which an
  animal can obtain pollen is determined by the total number of flowers on a plant, the fraction of
  flowers in bloom at any one time ($a$), the number of times ($j$) the plant has previously been
  visited by an animal, and the maximum fraction of flowers available for pollination ($\eta$). The
  formula for the number of total flowers available for visitation during a $k^{th}$ visit to the
  $j^{th}$ plant ($f_{j,k}$) is given by
  \begin{equation}\label{flowers}
    f_{j,k} = \phi \cdot a \cdot \eta^k.
  \end{equation}

  It is assumed that the amount of food eaten and the amount of pollen collected is proportional to
  the number of visited flowers. An animal collects pollen and eats from every flower that it
  visits, and so the amount of pollen collected and the amount of food eaten is proportional to the
  equation (\ref{flowers}). Let $f^{\left(i\right)}_{j,k}$ be the number of flowers visited by the
  $i^{th}$ animal during the $k^{th}$ visit to the $j^{th}$ plant then the amount of polllen/nectar
  in the $i^{th}$ animal's stomach after $m$ plant visits is given by
  \[
    c^{\left(i\right)}_m = \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta f^{\left(i\right)}_{j,k},
  \]
  where $\beta$ is the proportionallity constant for the amount of pollen collected at a plant.
  Each animal has a maximum amount of food they will ingest, $c_{max}$, at which time they will stop
  search for food and return to their lair. %The total amount of food that an animal can eat is
  limited
%by the stomach size, $c_{max}$.

  The fraction, $\alpha$, of all flowers are pollinated, and the associated probability that a
  flower is pollinated, $\rho$, are related by the equation,
  \begin{equation} \label{Prob}
    \alpha = \rho \cdot \hat{f}_k.
  \end{equation}
  Using equation (\ref{limit}) and (\ref{Prob}) we can determine the probability that a flower is
  pollinated, $\rho$, by the formula
  \[
    \rho = \frac{\alpha}{\phi} \cdot \frac{1 - \eta}{a \cdot \eta}.
  \]

  When a flower is pollinated it must determined which previous plant donated the pollen. Each
  flower visited is recorded and is available to pollinate the current flower, except those flowers
  that are on the same plant. Self- pollination, is not considered, because the likelyhood of
  self-pollination is low due to mechanisms that impedes self-pollination. Each flower considered
  has an equal likelihood of pollinating the current flower.

\subsection{Time and Stopping Criteria}
  The velocity an animal travels ($v$) is assumed to be constant, as well as the time spent on a
  plant ($t_{plant}$).  The travel time for an animal is then given by the formula
  \[
    t^{\left(i\right)} = \frac{s^{\left(i\right)}}{v} + T^{\left(i\right)} \cdot t_{plant},
  \]
  where $T^{\left(i\right)}$ is the number of plants visited by the $i^{th}$ animal. If we let the
  maximum allowable travel time be $t_{max}$, then once $t^{\left(i\right)} \geq t_{max}$ or
  $c^{\left(i\right)}_m \geq c_{max}$ the animal is removed from the simulation. $t_{max}$ is based
  on the optimal searching time during the day.  When there are no animals left the simulation
  terminates.

\subsection{Model Statistics}

  To best explore the inherent differences between biotic and abiotic pollination this study focuses
  on the effects of movement as well as the effects of plant density.

  In order to quantify these differences we measure statistics that are inherent of the animals:
  \emph{Average Path Distance}, \emph{Average Maximum Distance}, and those of the plant:
  \emph{Average Pollination Distance}, \emph{Average Maximum Pollination Distance}, \emph{Average
  Weighted Diversity of Fathers}.  The calculations of these statistics are given in the Table
  \ref{eqn}.

  In these equations it is assumed that $b$ is the total number of animals, $n$ is the total number
  of plants, $(x_{1,0}^{(i)},x_{2,0}^{(i)})$ is the starting location of the $i^{th}$ animal,
  $(x_{1,j}^{(i)},x_{2,j}^{(i)})$ is the location of the $i^{th}$ animal after $j$ steps,
  $\tau^{(i)}$ is the total number of seeds for the $i^{th}$ plant, $\Delta\tau^{(i)}$ is the number
  of different fathers contributing pollen to the $i^{th}$ plant, and $F_{j,i}$ is the number of
  times the $j^{th}$ father contributed pollen to the $i^{th}$ plant.
