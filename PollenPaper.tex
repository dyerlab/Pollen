\begin{abstract} 
  The understanding of gene movement in plant species is critical to the management
  of both plant and animal species reliant on that plant.  Pollen is the mechanism by which plants
  pass their genetic material from one generation to the next. Pollen dispersal studies have focused
  primarily on purely random diffusion processes, while this may be a good assumption for species
  pollinated mainly by abiotic means, such as wind, it is most likely an over simplification for
  species that are pollinated by biotic means, such as insects \cite{Chan}.

  Correlated random walk (CRW) models are a model of animal movement \cite{Prasad05} and have been
  successfully used to explore the movement of animals in varying ecological contexts
  \cite{Bartumeus07}. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to describe pollen movement via insects
  as a correlated random walk (CRW). This model is used to explore how insect path lengths and pollen
  distribution are affected by the varying turning angle and plant density.
